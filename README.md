# Indoor-Navigation
NCR Hackathon 2021 project

When we go to a huge supermarket or mall etc., we all are confused at some point about where to look for a particular product or stall or store. worry no more. With this application we intend to solve this problem.

All you have to do is to choose nearby stall and search for the product or stall where you want to go. a dynamic route will be drawn between those two locations no matter if they are on same floor or different one.

With the ability to search for a product you can find out if the exact product you want is in stock and if not no need to bother going to the section to find it out for yourself.

At the moment we are using this application to navigate any supermarket layout. but, it can easily be modified to make it useful for airports, offices, stadiums, for that matter anything.

Since we take the input from user on his location we don't need to rely on GPS or bluetooth beacons to know about the position (Although using these technologies will make realtime navigation possible, project can be extended if that is needed).

We can show on the homepage all the promotions going on at that moment and can get the attention of the user and direct him to that location.

Since we have many products in hospitality and retail space (like POS systems) we can provide this application as an addon to our customers and this product will add value to their businesses.
